        questions: [
            {
                question: "What makes Proudmoore different from other Cataclysm servers?",
                answer: "Proudmoore isn’t just another Cataclysm realm, it is expanding on well-tested concepts to make the expansion well rounded for hardcore and casual players alike.. We’re introducing Mythic+ dungeons, solo-rated PvP queues, a variety of new leveling paths, and cross-faction systems, all while preserving the core Cataclysm experience."
            },
            {
                question: "Who is running Proudmoore? Is it a new team or a revival?",
                answer: "Proudmoore is a fresh project from experienced hands, a collaboration utilizing Twinstar’s infrastructure and a new team composed of private server veterans with years of experience managing projects. With heavy focus on community and quality, we aim to create the best Cataclysm project possible."
            },
            {
                question: "Why did you choose Cataclysm as the expansion?",
                answer: "Cataclysm is often misunderstood. Beneath its controversial changes lies the most refined class design in WoW’s classic era, along with world revamps, and PvP systems that deserve a second chance. We believe 4.3.4, when modernized and rebalanced, offers an incredibly rewarding gameplay loop, and we’re here to prove it."
            },
            {
                question: "Will the server be Blizzlike or custom",
                answer: "Consider Proudmoore as a hybrid. The content and progression will stay true to Blizzard’s Cataclysm, but the systems and mechanics behind it will have been modernized for 2025. We stay true to Blizzard’s design foundations, but we’re not afraid to fix what’s broken or expand where the original fell short."
            },
            {
                question: "How long has this server been in development?",
                answer: "Proudmoore utilizes Twinstar’s Cataclysm core, which has been in development for nearly 17 years now. We’ve rebuilt and refined virtually every aspect of the game’s code from the ground up, ensuring every feature we launch with is production-ready and sustainable."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the server's long-term plan?",
                answer: "Our goal is to provide a living, evolving Cataclysm experience. That means seasonal content rotations, fresh incentives for PvE and PvP, community events, and continuous balance updates. When the realm hits its natural end of progression, we will move away from blizzlike and begin experimental changes to keep things feeling fresh."
            },
            {
                question: "Will Proudmoore reset or wipe in the future?",
                answer: "No, Proudmoore is not a seasonal or time-limited project. Your progress is here to stay. While we may explore optional fresh starts in the distant future, the main realm will never be wiped or reset."
            },
            {
                question: "Is there a roadmap available post-launch?",
                answer: "Yes. A full roadmap will be published shortly after launch, detailing our timeline for Mythic+ rotations, seasonal events, new systems, and quality-of-life updates. Proudmoore is a living project, and we’re committed to full transparency as we grow."

        title: "Gameplay & Features",
        questions: [
            {
                question: "What are the XP, gold, rep, and drop rates?",
                answer: "We designed Proudmoore’s rates around <strong>balancing casual gameplay and long-term sustainability</strong>. Here’s how each one fits into that vision:<br><ul><li><strong>XP (1x–3x, toggleable):</strong><br>Leveling should feel rewarding, not tedious. With 3x default rates, players who can only play on weekends or casually here and there should make meaningful progression without feeling left behind. There will be additional bonuses to this as well, specifically on weekends and holidays. We have a toggle for xp rates, so you can choose the pace you want to take. Some want to get through leveling as fast as possible, others want to experience leveling to the fullest, we give you the freedom to choose.</li><li><strong>Reputation (1x with weekend bonuses):</strong><br>Rep grinds define Cataclysm’s endgame. We keep the baseline Blizzlike to preserve progression value but offer weekend boosts to ease the burden for working players.</li><li><strong>Loot & Gold (1x):</strong><br>Gold inflation kills economies. We keep loot and gold at 1x to maintain item value, prevent bot abuse, and ensure professions and player trading matter. It also ensures vendor and repair costs retain meaning over time.</li><li><strong>Rare Materials (~1.2x in Heroics/Raids):</strong><br>Slightly increasing rare material drops in challenging content rewards group play and supports crafting progression without flooding the market. It also makes dungeons feel more rewarding over time.</li><li><strong>Professions (1x with weekend XP bonuses):</strong><br>Gathering and crafting should be meaningful, not skippable. Keeping 1x ensures steady progression, while weekend boosts give a natural catch-up window for players with limited time.</li><li><strong>Honor (1.25x with weekend bonuses):</strong><br>PvP gearing shouldn’t be a second job. Slightly higher Honor gain respects your time while keeping gear acquisition paced enough to support healthy seasons and ladder progression. Bonuses to Honor Rates will be substantially focused on prime-time to encourage large queues.</li><li><strong>Justice / Valor Points (1x with weekly activity bonuses):</strong><br>PvE currency remains at 1x to preserve reward pacing, but active players are rewarded through weekly activity bonuses that speed things up without trivializing content.</li></ul>",
                additionalInfoTitle: "In short:",
                additionalInfoText: "We want progression to feel <span class='italic'>earned</span> but <span class='italic'>not exhausting</span>. These rates avoid the burnout of 1x-only grinds while steering clear of retail-level handouts. You’ll feel rewarded for your time and the economy will feel alive for months to come, unlike other projects."
            },
            {
                question: "Is there RF (Raid Finder)?",
                answer: "Nope, no Raid Finder. It was originally implemented on the Dragon Soul raid, and was extremely unpopular/controversial. We have no intentions of adding it here."
            },
            {
                question: "What's the status of Rated BGs, Arenas, and Solo Queue?",
                answer: "All <strong>Rated PvP</strong> modes will be released with season launch, at the same time as raid releases. <strong>Unrated</strong> Solo Queue for Arenas is enabled from launch as an additional leveling path, as well as <strong>Unrated Battlegrounds</strong>. Rated Battlegrounds are fully functional and will be tied into seasonal rewards."
            },
            {
                question: "Are there cross-faction BGs/dungeons?",
                answer: "Yes. Proudmoore features full cross-faction queuing for battlegrounds, dungeons, and raids."
            },
            {
                question: "Are any classes or specs disabled or rebalanced?",
                answer: "No classes or specs are disabled or rebalanced. There are some slight rebalances towards end game content to adjust for the fact we are using the 4.3.4 client. When we hit end-of-progression, we will begin to experiment with class/spec rebalancing to keep content fresh."
            },
            {
                question: "Are battlegroups active or merged in any way?",
                answer: "This is a private server project, meaning we only have a single server. Battlegroups as they exist in Blizzard & Retail are redundant, all players are part of a single matchmaking pool for PVP & RDF/RF."
            },
            {
                question: "Are dungeons/raids scripted? To what level of completion?",
                answer: "Yes, all Cataclysm dungeons and raids are fully scripted. We are utilizing Twinstar’s Cataclysm core, which has over 17 years of development. From dungeon mechanics to boss events and AI behavior, you can expect the full experience."
            },
            {
                question: "What tier does the server launch with?",
                answer: "We launch pre-Tier 11: Bastion of Twilight, Blackwing Descent, and Throne of the Four Winds. Tier 11 raids will become available in a week or two after launch date (TBA). Future tiers will be staggered based on community progression, not static dates."
            },
            {
                question: "How do gear progression and catch-up systems work?",
                answer: "Gear progression will follow Blizzard’s progression, with the exception of our additions of Mythic+ dungeons, and Casual Mode Raids. Mythic+ will serve as a stepping stone between heroic dungeons and normal raids, and casual mode raids will serve as lowering the skill curve needed to go from dungeons to raiding. Our catch-up systems will be announced at a later date, but will essentially incentivize players joining in late to catch up to current content without getting punished for it."
            },
            {
                question: "Is there PvE or PvP progression gating?",
                answer: "Progression will be gated logically, and mostly following Blizzards original timeline. As mentioned before, we will not have static dates for future patch progression, instead we will have a blend of potential timelines, balanced with analytics on individual player progression and participation metrics. Essentially, we want to progress through patches without leaving players behind, while also keeping track of hardcore raider progression. It is not possible to time this perfect for all audiences, but we will do our best."
            },
            {
                question: "Is world PvP encouraged? How?",
                answer: "We will be keeping a close eye on World PvP. If there is a sizeable amount of players participating in it and forming groups specifically for it, we will further incentivize it. We do not want Proudmoore to become a griefing fiesta, but we do want to encourage group World PvP if there is an interest in it."

                question: "Do you have dual spec? Is it free or gold-based?",

            },
            {
                question: "Are there custom zones or events?",
                answer: "No custom zones, but there will be plenty of events. We will explore the more “custom” parts of Cataclysm when we hit end of progression and players begin to get bored of 4.3.4 content."
            },
            {
                question: "Will we see Timewalking Mythic+ equivalents, or class tuning?",

Class tuning will be addressed at the end of content progression. We may possibly tune some end-game gear for Arenas and Rated Battlegrounds. Timewalking is under consideration as part of future seasonal content."

                answer: "Any 4.3.4 client will work with Proudmoore. You can find this via Google. Additionally, we will be providing download links for our own 4.3.4 client, closer to launch date."

            {
                question: "Is there a launcher? Patcher?",
                answer: "No. Without getting too deep in the weeds, a launcher or patcher is an executable program, an .exe. Any custom .exe a private server produces will likely be unsigned, meaning it does not have a “digital certificate” ensuring it is safe. This is why most projects with a custom .exe tell you to “run the program as administrator”, because it bypasses any security protocols that will trigger when running an unsigned .exe. In layman’s terms, it is not safe and there is no guarantee on what you are installing and what access it has to your computer. Proudmoore will never encourage players to download an use an unsigned .exe."

If there is a boss that is too difficult to do on your own, does that mean you log into a second account to down it? No, it means you find a friend to help. Players are allowed to multibox when it comes to crafting, banking, and other things inside major cities. We do not allow multiboxing in leveling, battlegrounds, raids, dungeons, etc."

                answer: "No, but it’s <strong>highly recommended</strong>. Most announcements and support updates will happen on Discord first. You don’t need to talk or join voice — just being in the server keeps you in the loop."

                answer: "We will offer a number of cosmetic and QoL perks for donors. We want to emphasize here that donating on Proudmoore is not intended to create an “upper class” of players with unique advantages not available to players. Every single thing in our shop will be available to players by playing the game. Our shop is for players who want to support our project, and a majority of the funding gained from it goes directly back into the community."

                question: "Is the shop only cosmetic, or does it have boosts?",
                answer: "The shop is <strong>strictly cosmetic and utility-based</strong>. No gear, power, or progression can be purchased. We are committed to <strong>no pay-to-win</strong>. Ever. We are the only Cataclysm private server that offers this, and we plan to keep it that way."

Players can choose to donate for transmogs, but these are optional and not restricted to only paying players. We are the only Cataclysm private server that offers this for free."

                answer: "NO. Never. Proudmoore will never use lootboxes or RNG-based purchased. We may add lootboxes in-game as an incentive for things such as RDF queues, but these will always be free features. All donation items are transparently priced with clear descriptions — no bait-and-switch mechanics."

                question: "Is the server pay-to-win in any form?",
                answer: "Absolutely not. Proudmoore is built on integrity and balance. Donors support the server, not their performance. That being said, some players may view things such as experience rate boosts as P2W. Proudmoore is built upon the idea that players do not have the time they used to in their busy lives, but still want to be able to enjoy playing the game. Any optional service we offer in the store will be with these players in mind. But we will never allow these services to interfere with actual competition, such as realm first races. No P2W. Ever."

                answer: "There are a number of addons that are automation-based and respond with inputs, these are not allowed. The line on this is not exactly black and white, so we will give discretion towards players. There are addons that will automate auction house sales, both buying and selling. These make you no different than a bot. If you are using addons that make you look like a bot, you may be handled by our GM team like you are a bot."

                answer: "Moderation will be <strong>light, but active</strong>. We aim for a free, fun environment. There will not be any “big brother” watching down on you here. Any conversation that goes too far will result in a warning from a GM privately. Racism, hate speech, spam, or harassment will be removed quickly. GMs are there to support the community, not police it unnecessarily."

            {
                question: "What's your policy on toxicity and harassment?",
                answer: "We take it seriously, and understand there is nuance to the words “toxicity” and “harassment”, especially in an MMORPG like WoW. Banter, goading, trolling, these are all things that are very common in the way that people act towards each other, even friends. We take this understanding very seriously when it comes to our GM team. Every GM with permissions to moderate chat will explicitly prove that they are able to see the nuance here, and understand when banter becomes hostile and aggressive. There are in-game systems to block people from your chat, we expect players to use them. But repeated instances of bullying or harassment will result in punishments."

                question: "Can I advertise my stream/guild in global chat?",
                answer: "Yes, <strong>within reason</strong>. Occasional guild recruitment or stream announcements are allowed in moderation. Repeating ads or spamming global chat will result in mutes or timeouts. Be respectful of the space, and of the players. If you post your ads and players begin getting vocally upset, and you continue anyways, we will see your ad as disruptive to the community, within reason."

                answer: "No, we <strong>do not accept transfers from other private servers</strong>. Proudmoore is a fresh, fair start for everyone. Allowing external transfers would compromise integrity and balance. Other Cataclysm projects have P2W stores, and accepting transfers would mean accepting P2W players."

If this is something we decide to do, please keep in mind that the stability of the fresh realms competition and fairness will be prioritized over your legacy character."

We will hold space to say that there could be future realms based on our community, but that is a discussion for years down the road. If we do ever have any future realms besides Proudmoore, fresh starts will never force wipes on the main realm."

This will be updated and we will have a Discord announcement when this information is clear. To be clear, developers do not monitor Discord. Complaining about bugs or demanding fixes there will not result in what you want. As an administration team, we do believe that sometimes bugs are critical enough that they warrant public discussion, and we do encourage players to speak up if they see something critical. But we will have standard processes for handling bugs that all players must go through. As a courtesy, our GM Team extends a strong helping hand when players experience bugs. If you experience a bug that is blocking your progression or creating another issue that needs quick resolution, please make a GM Ticket in-game."

                answer: "TBA. On Proudmoore, we approach everything with facts and data. How aggressively we roll out updates will depend on the amount of bugs we encounter and the severity. Proudmoore is running a core that has been in active development for 17 years, so we are not too concerned about this."

                answer: "No. We strongly believe in allowing our staff team to work in the environment that is best for them. Time spent chatting or getting derailed in Discord is time that could be spent fixing priority issues. We will hold this boundary for our Developers, and for our Game Masters as well, if they do not want to be present on the public Discord. That being said, our administration team and community management team will be informed and knowledgeable about any subject relevant to development.
